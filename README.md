Malls and shopping complexes often compete with each other to increase their customer base and hence make huge profits. To achieve this task machine learning is being applied in many stores already.It is amazing to realize the fact that how machine learning can aid in such ambitions. AI and ML already have been intimately involved in online shopping since, well, the beginning of online shopping.The shopping complexes make use of their customer's data and develop ML models to target the right customers.This not only increases sales but also makes their business efficient.
